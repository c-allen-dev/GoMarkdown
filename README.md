# Convert general markdown to slack markdown

For example, we can bold the text using "*" sign in web or other markdown template, but it not work in slack.
So we need to convert to "**" and also we consider several cases.
Golang provides module for markdown but it doesn't provides markdown for all slack markdown.
You can use this convert function to get all slack markdown in your project.
